Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.3                       (DAL/BTU) v2.3 (2007-02-02)
     
     Enhancement Release (2.3) following the Working Group meetings 
     of Oct-Nov/2006-Jan/2007. No backward-incompatible changes.
     Archiving loosened even more. New structures for all the DTDs. 
     
  6. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-07-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  5. ADDRESS-ELEMENTS - added <email> and <uri> to everywhere 
     <ext-link> was allowed, by renaming %ext-link.class; to
     %address-link.class; and using it:
        <email> and <uri> should be added to 
         - %emphasized-text;
         - %simple-phrase;
 
  4. INLINE MATH - Added %inline-math.class; (formerly -%inline-math;)
     everywhere -%inline-display; was allowed:
        - %disp-formula-elements;
        - %emphasized.text;
        - %simple-phrase;
        - %simple-text;
 
  3.  CHANGED PES TO BEGIN WITH "|"
        ### Customization Alert ### - Changed the PE to begin 
        with an OR bar
        - %disp-formula-elements;
        - %emphasized-text; (used in most of the format elements)
                 
  2. PARAMETER ENTITY CLEANUP AND REGULARIZATION

     a. MODIFY INLINE PARAMETER MIXES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Changed the inline-mix Parameter Entities to use the 
        OR-bar-first mechanism. This requires changing not
        only the Parameter Entity, but all content models that
        use the entity.
        - %emphasized-text; (used in most of the format elements)
        - %simple-phrase; 
        - %simple-text; 
        The following PEs were already in OR-bar-first form and were
        not changed:
        - %rendition-plus;
        
     b. RENAME EXISTING CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Some classes did not have the ".class" suffix in their
        names. Changed the names to add the class suffix.
        - %block-math.class; used in 
             - %para-level;
        - %inline-math.class; used in 
             - %disp-formula-elements;
             - %emphasized-text;
             - %simple-phrase; 
             - %simple-text; 

     c. LINK CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        - Deleted 
            - %link.class;, 
            - %inpara-address; 
            - %ext-links.class;
        - Replaced above with four link classes: 
          (some unchanged from before)
            - %address-link.class;   (the links used in addresses)
            - %fn-link.class.class;  (just fn)
            - %simple-link.class;    (the internal links, same)
            - %article-link.class;   (links for journal article)
        - All occurrences of %link.class replaced with
            - %address-link.class; and 
            - %simple-link.class;, and 
            - %article-link.class;  links
        - Replaced all occurrences of %ext-links.class; with
          the new %address-links.class;
        - This changed the following Parameter Entities (no DTD 
          model change):
            - %disp-formula-elements;
            - %emphasized.text; 
            - %simple-phrase; 

     d. PARA CLASS
        ### Customization Alert ###
        - Deleted %para.class; 
        - Its place in the definition of the Paragraph <p> element 
          will be taken by the -%p-elements; entity.
        - Its place in other mixes will be taken by the combination
          of %just-para.class; and %rest-of-para.class;

<!--                    Only the simplest of the typographic 
                        emphasis elements, as well as subscript and
                        superscript.  Usually used in a model that
                        allows #PCDATA and this restricted mixture.
                        This mix may be stripped down to only
                        subscript and superscript by some, more
                        restrictive DTDs.                         
                        DTD Maintenance Note: This Parameter Entity
                        and the related PE "rendition-plus" have
                        been put in place to restrict the amount of
                        variability that a person modifying the DTD
                        through PE redefinition can achieve. Some
                        elements have been set #PCDATA plus one PE
                        and some have been set to #PCDATA plus the
                        other in an effort to allow designers to
                        modify entire groups of elements, but not
                        to change similar models individually .    -->
