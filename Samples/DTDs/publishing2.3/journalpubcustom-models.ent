Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.3                       (DAL/BTU) v2.3 (2007-02-02)
     
     Enhancement Release (2.3) following the Working Group meetings 
     of Oct-Nov/2006-Jan/2007. No backward-incompatible changes.
     Archiving loosened even more. New structures for all the DTDs. 
     
 40. FIG MODEL ELEMENTS - Added <chem-struct-wrapper> to the 
     contents of <figure> using -%chem-struct-wrap.class; inside 
     -%fig-mod; so that you can use a <chem-struct-wrapper> anywhere 
     you can use a <disp-formula>.
     
 39. CONTENT TYPE - The attribute "content-type" added to the
     following elements to preserve/add semantic distinctions:
      - graphic (through graphic-atts)
      - inline-graphic (through inline-graphic-atts)
     
 38. GRAPHIC ATTS - In the parameter entity -%graphic-atts;
     made the following changes:
     
     a) Unfixed the "mimetype" attribute from
           mimetype  CDATA   #FIXED 'image'
        into this:
           mimetype  CDATA   #IMPLIED
      
     b) Made the "mime-subtype" attribute into a CDATA rather 
        than a list of values
        
     c) Added "content-type" attribute to preserve or add semantic
        distinctions.
     
 37. INLINE GRAPHIC ATTS - In the parameter entity 
     -%inline-graphic-atts; made the following changes:
     
     a) Unfixed the "mimetype" attribute from
           mimetype  CDATA   #FIXED 'image'
        into this:
           mimetype  CDATA   #IMPLIED
        
     b) Added "content-type" attribute to preserve or add semantic
        distinctions.
        
     c. Added "baseline-shift" attribute to preserve the positioning
        of the inline graphic relative to the text baseline.
     
 36. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL - Added <trans-title>* and 
     <trans-subtitle>* to the contents of <journal-meta>. 
     This is a temporary insertion for version 2.3. A 
     more structured model for translated titles may be 
     introduced in version 3.0.
     
 35. PERSON GROUP ATTRIBUTES
     a) Added "id" attribute of type ID
     
 34. ARTICLE METADATA MODEL
     a) Added <grant-num> and <grant-sponsor> to the contents of 
     <article-meta>. This is a temporary insertion for version 2.3. 
     A more structured model for grant material and sponsorship 
     is expected to be introduced in version 3.0.
     
 33. SEC MODEL - Changed model to require that either a <label>
     or a <title> be required, instead of requiring a <title>.
     Now there must be one or the other, and there may be both.
       This changes <sec> and <app>.
     
 32. ANONYMOUS - Set <anonymous> (new element) model to EMPTY
     
 31. NLM CITATION - Added <nlm-citation> as an alternative to
     unstructured <citation>s by adding <nlm-citation>
     to -%citation.class;. This changed the models for:
      - <ref>, which uses -%citation.class; inside %ref-model;
      
 30. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.2                       (DAL/BTU) v2.2 (2006-04-30)
     
     Backwards-compatible changes to meet operational needs.
     Typical changes include adding attribute values and making 
     required elements optional.
          
 29. PREFORMAT ELEMENTS - Added -%phrase.class; to allow use of
     <named-content> inside <preformat>.
          
 28. PERSON-GROUP-TYPE ATTRIBUTE VALUES - Added "director"
          
 27. SECTION MODELS
 
     a. Added optional <label> to the start of the
     content models for section (-%sec-model;) and section optional
     title model (-%sec-opt-title-model;). The Blue DTD is being
     used for articles that have already been published.
     
     b. Added new element <sec-meta> to the start of the
     content models for section (-%sec-model;) and section optional
     title model (-%sec-opt-title-model;). There are sections that
     are authored independently, even in journal articles, and 
     this is the start of allowing additional metadata for such
     sections. The first content for <sec-meta> will be 
     <contrib-group>
          
 26. PUBLISHER LOC - Allowed <email>, <uri>, and <ext-link>
     inside <publisher-loc>. Change to %publisher-loc-elements;
  
 25. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
          
     Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
     Added new material requested by the online list     

 24. FN TYPES - Made into a parameter entity

 23. CORRESP MODEL - Added <label> to elements allowed to be
     inside the <corresp> element, using -%label.class; This made
     the -%corresp-elements override the same as the basic default,
     so -%corresp-elements was removed from this module.

 22. CONFERENCE MODEL - Conference theme was required, which seems
     to be an error. Is now optional.

 21. PREFORMAT ELEMENTS - Added %display-back-matter; back to 
     %preformat-elements; to align Blue with the Suite on
     permissions.

 20. PERMISSIONS - Added a new <permissions> wrapper element to
     consolidate copyright and licensing information. For backwards
     compatibility, the new element will be added alongside the
     existing copyright elements. Best practice will be to use the
     new container, but <copyright-statement>, <copyright-year>,
     and <license> will be accepted in their old positions inside
     <article-meta>
      - Added <permissions> to <article-meta> model
      - Added <copyright-holder> to <permissions>
      - Moved <copyright-year> to the common module
      - Moved <license> to common module
      - Moved -%license-atts; to common module
      - Moved -%license-model; to common module
               
 19. JOURNAL TITLES
       a) Added <journal-subtitle> to <journal-meta> through
          -%journal-meta-model;. New element defined in -%common.ent;.
          
 18. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202" 
          
     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                  (Beck/DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
          
     Minor tweaks before public release. Decision was made not to
     change release number

 17. LIST ITEM - Removed over-ride for <list-item>, which has the
     effect of adding an optional <label> at front of model

 16. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL - Made publisher optional

 15. FOOTNOTE ATTRIBUTES - Added the "symbol" attribute back to
     Footnote attributes

 14. DISP-FORMULA - Added -%label.class; therefore removed it 
     from this module, as it was then the same as in the
     basic Suite math.ent

 13. AFF-ELEMENTS - Added -%label.class;; therefore removed it 
     from this module, as it was then the same as in the
     basic Suite math.ent

 12. ARTICLE METADATA MODEL -
     a. COUNTS - Added to article metadata model
     b. ARTICLE-ID - Made optional and repeatable (was required
        and repeatable)
     c. COPYRIGHT-YEAR - Made optional

 11. FOOTNOTE - Delete over-ride of content model. This has the
     effect of making the Publishing DTD the same as base, 
     adding an optional <label> at the front of footnote.

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

 10. OVER-RIDE OF ARTICLE-META-MODEL - Added new elements
     a. <custom-meta-wrap> containing <custom-meta>
     b. <email>
     c. <issue-id>
     d. <issue-title> (for special title or theme)
     e. <page-range>
     f. <volume-id>
     g. <license> (for now, just a bucket into which to
        dump license-related material until the AIT Workgroup
        does more analysis)

  9. MOVE AND REMOVE PARAMETER ENTITY DECLARATIONS
     - Deleted duplicate %might-link-atts; (There were two!)
     - Collected ATTLIST over-rides into one place.
     - Deleted all the Parameter Entities which were
       duplicated in this module ONLY because they were
       needed to parse subsequent entities.

  8. ADDRESS-ELEMENTS - added <email> and <uri> to everywhere 
     <ext-link> was allowed, by renaming %ext-link.class; to
     %address-link.class; and using it:
        <email> and <uri> should be added to 
         - %article-meta-model;
         - %aff-elements;
         - %p-elements;

  7.  FOOT NOTE ATTRIBUTES
       - added "symbol"

  6.  Replaced element names in OR groups with the appropriate
      classes. Not a model change, just entity usage:
       - %array-model;
       - %fig-group-model;
       - %list-item-model;
 
  5. ACCESS CLASS
        ### Customization Alert ###
     a. Took <ext-link> out of -%access.class;. It did not belong.
        It belongs in -%address-link.class;
     b. Added -%address-link.class; to anywhere regular
        %access.class; was used.

  4. OVER-RIDE OF ARTICLE-META-MODEL - Added new elements
     a. <custom-meta-wrap> containing <custom-meta>
     b. <email>
     c. <issue-id>
     d. <issue-title> (for special title or theme)
     e. <page-range>
     f. <volume-id>

  3. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     a. Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
        the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now,
        as this is the most flexible system, allowing for
        #PCDATA, mixed, or element content. (This is in direct
        contrast to the "-element" suffixed models, which are
        designed to prohibit element content and permit only
        #PCDATA or mixed content.)
     -  %article-meta-model; (added parentheses to Parameter
        Entity and removed them from Element Declaration)
     - %abstract-model;
     - %ack-model;
     - %array-model;
     - %author-notes-model;
     - %def-item-model;
     - %fig-group-model;
     - %gloss-group-model;
     - %journal-meta-model;
     - %list-model;
     - %ref-model;
     - %sec-model;
     - %sec-opt-title-model;
     - %trans-abstract-model;

  2. PARAMETER ENTITIES FOR CLASSES/MIXES/ATT LISTS

     a. NEW PARAMETER ENTITIES - To correct potential classing 
        problems,  new Parameter Entities were created. The following
        PEs and models were changed to use these new PEs:
             New Content model PEs:
        - %just-para.class;  used in 
             - %list-item-model; 
        - In <author-notes> "(corresp | fn)+" was replaced
            with the %fn-link.class; and the new class
            -%corresp.class; and )
 
     b. RENAMED CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Not all classes ended in the ".class" suffix. Changed the 
        following to add the class suffix:
        - %address-elements; (also renamed this one -%address.class;!)
          used in:
             - %aff-elements; 
             - %corresp-elements; 
        - %block-math.class; and -%inline-math.class; used in 
             - %p-elements;
        - %display-back-matter.class; used in 
             - %array-model;
        - %rest-of-para.class;
          Inside the content model for Paragraph <p>, was renamed 
          -%p-elements;. The content model for Named Content 
          and %p-elements; still use %rest-of-para.class;.

     c. LINK CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        - Deleted 
            - %link.class;, 
            - %inpara-address; 
            - %ext-links.class;
        - Replaced above with four link classes: 
          (some unchanged from before)
            - %address-link.class;   (the links used in addresses)
            - %fn-link.class.class;  (just fn)
            - %simple-link.class;    (the internal links, same)
            - %article-link.class;   (links for journal article)
        - All occurrences of %link.class replaced with
            - %address-link.class; and 
            - %simple-link.class;, and 
            - %article-link.class;  links
        - Replaced all occurrences of %ext-links.class; with
          the new %address-links.class;
        - This changed the following Parameter Entities (no DTD 
          model change):
            - %disp-formula-elements;
            - %emphasized.text; 
            - %simple-phrase; 

     d. PARA CLASS
        ### Customization Alert ###
        - Deleted %para.class; 
        - Its place in the definition of the Paragraph <p> element 
          will be taken by the -%p-elements; entity.
        - Its place in other mixes will be taken by the combination
          of %just-para.class; and %rest-of-para.class;

     journal publishing customization module (journalpubcustomize.ent)
