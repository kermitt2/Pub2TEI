            <s>Although shifting cultivation is the major land use type in Laos, the spatial-temporal patterns and the associated carbon emissions of shifting cultivation in Laos are largely unknown.</s>
            <s>This study provides a nationwide analysis of the spatial-temporal patterns of shifting cultivation and estimations of the associated carbon emissions in Laos over the last three decades.</s>

            <s>Combining biomass derived from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation and shifting cultivation maps and area estimates, we found that the net carbon emissions from shifting cultivation declined in 2001-2015 but increased in 2016-2020.</s>

            <s>In addition, there were increased emissions from intensified use of fallow lands.</s>

        <p>
          <s>Shifting cultivation is an agricultural practice where farmers routinely move from one plot to another for cultivation.</s>
          <s>It begins with the practice of 'slash-andburn' , where trees and woody plants are cut down and burnt to prepare an ash-fertilized plot for temporary cultivation.</s>
          <s>After short-term cultivation, the plot is abandoned, which allows the vegetation to recover.</s>
          <s>Shifting cultivation is the predominant land use and a major cause of forest degradation and deforestation in some tropical countries <ref type="bibr">(Heinimann et al 2017</ref>
          <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Curtis et al 2018</ref>
          <ref type="bibr">, Jiang et al 2022)</ref>, such as Laos <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen et al 2023)</ref>, and the Democratic Republic of Congo <ref type="bibr">(Molinario et al 2015)</ref>.</s>
          <s>Monitoring shifting cultivation is complicated, because it is highly dynamic, and the area affected by each slash-and-burn event is small.</s>
          <s>Due to the difficulty of monitoring shifting cultivation, spatially and temporally explicit information on shifting cultivation is scarce.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Shifting cultivation has both short-term and long-term effects on carbon emissions <ref type="bibr">(Ziegler et al 2012)</ref>.</s>
          <s>In the short term, the slash-and-burn activities cause immediate release of carbon.</s>
          <s>In the long term, encroachment of shifting cultivation into primary forest and intensified use of secondary forest both lead to long-term increases in net carbon emissions and degradation of ecosystems.</s>
          <s>Carbon emissions from shifting cultivation have not been well quantified, because of the lack of methodology for monitoring shifting cultivation and tracking the associated carbon dynamics.</s>
          <s>In contrast to deforestation (such as urbanization), which does not involve carbon sequestration, shifting cultivation involves both carbon emissions associated with slash-and-burn activities and carbon sequestration during the fallow period.</s>
          <s>Due to the complexity of monitoring shifting cultivation and tracking the associated carbon dynamics, estimates of carbon emissions or sequestration from shifting cultivation are usually unavailable in REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) reporting.</s>

          <s>It is estimated that shifting cultivation affected 32.9 Â± 1.9% of Laos from 1991 to 2020, and the shifting cultivation activities increased in the most recent 5 years <ref                type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen et al 2023)</ref>.</s>
          <s>Laos' population has been increasing steadily from 4.314 million in 1990 to 7.319 million in 2020 (World Bank 2023), whereas upland rice yields did not distinctly improve between 1990 and 2020.</s>
          <s>Shifting cultivation activities are expected to increase due to the increasing demand for rice.</s>
          <s>Monitoring shifting cultivation and analyzing its patterns are important to understand the forest cover change in Laos and relevant to achieving Laos' goal of increasing forest cover to 70% (The current forest cover is 62%) (The Government of Lao PDR 2005).</s>
          <s>Since there were few spatially and temporally explicit maps and estimates of shifting cultivation before <ref                type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al (2023)</ref>, carbon emissions from shifting cultivation have not            been accurately estimated in the REDD+ reporting of Laos (Department of Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture            and Forestry, Lao PDR 2018).</s>
        </p>
        <p>
          <s>Spatially and temporally explicit information about shifting cultivation in Laos was unavailable until recently <ref            type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen et al 2023)</ref>, and a comprehensive national-scale analysis of the spatial        and temporal patterns of shifting cultivation has not been conducted to date.</s>
          <s>A traditional approach for mapping shifting cultivation is to create landscape mosaics based on a land cover map of a single year <ref                type="bibr">(Messerli et al 2009</ref>

          <s>It is impossible to analyze the temporal patterns of shifting cultivation using this traditional approach.</s>
          <s>Another approach is to use multi-temporal land cover data to map shifting cultivation <ref type="bibr">(Leisz and Rasmussen 2012</ref>

          <s>In previous studies, the temporal resolution of the land cover maps was not high enough to support the analysis of temporal patterns <ref                type="bibr">(Heinimann et al 2013)</ref>.</s>
          <s>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al (2023)</ref> used satellite data to create shifting            cultivation products for Laos with sufficient temporal frequency (annual) and spatial resolution (30 m) to            support a nationalscale spatial-temporal analysis.</s>
